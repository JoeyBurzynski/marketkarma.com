          <div><strong>1. Acceptance of the Terms of Service</strong></div>
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          <div>Welcome to MarketKarma.com (a.k.a. "we" or "us" or the "Company"), we're excited to have you as user and member of
            the community. The following terms and conditions (collectively, these "Terms of Service") apply to your use of
            www.marketkarma.com, including any content, functionality and services offered on or via MarketKarma.com (the
            "Website").</div>
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          <div>The Terms of Service also include our Privacy Policy, that you can review here:</div>
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          <div><a href="https://www.marketkarma.com/privacy/" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">https://www.marketkarma.com/privacy/</a></div>
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          <div>We want to keep our relationship with you as lean and informal as possible, but please read the Terms of Service
            carefully before you start using our services or browsing MarketKarma.com, because by using the Website you accept and
            agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service.</div>
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          <div>Should you disagree with some of the provisions herein, you can either leave the Website (although we'll be sad to
            see you go!), or contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@marketkarma.com">hello@marketkarma.com</a>.&nbsp;</div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <div><strong>2. Changes to the Terms of Service and the Website</strong></div>
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          <div>MarketKarma.com (and our affiliated services) are a work in progress, meaning that a lot will change in the near
            future. We reserve the right to update the Website and these Terms of Service from time to time, at our discretion. We
            will make sure to announce any major change in a prominent way.&nbsp; Of course, this document is public on
            MarketKarma, and you will be able to see the changes for any new version. Your continued use of our services
            (including the Website)&nbsp; following the publishing of updated Terms of Service means that you accept and agree to

            to suspend or restrict access to some features to users. In any case, we will not be liable if for any reason all or
            any part of our services are unavailable at any time or for any period, nor for any data loss (see also section 7
            below).</div>
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          <div>To access certain features of our website you have to register by entering your email and choosing a password as
            part of our security procedures. You must treat such information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third party
            and only using our services in person. There is a password reset procedure in case you forget your password, but
            please notify us of any breach of security. We highly recommend to choose a strong password (e.g. "U049^B9Ppi*4vowp")
            and that you log out from your account at the end of every session.</div>
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          <div>It is a condition of your use of our services that all the information you provide is correct, current and
            complete. In the future, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. As custom for
            web applications and sites, we reserve the right to disable any user account, at any time in our sole discretion for
            any or no reason, including, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any provision of these Terms of Service.
